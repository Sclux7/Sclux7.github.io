        <h1>Welcome to the CTF writeup page!</h1>
        <p>As much as it pains me to do this, I figure it will be easier to just link people this page so they can see writeups easily without having to find them. This will be the ONLY exception to my "Only 1 page full of everything" rule. If you would like to visit the main page please click <h1><a href="https://sclux7.world/">here.</a></h1> Be warned, it is not at all as tidy as this one.</p>
